# LinkedIn AI Agent - 4-Agent Content Creation Workflow
# Sequential tasks for LinkedIn content creation with style matching priority

brainstorming_task:
  description: >
    You are conducting an interactive brainstorming conversation with the user about their content idea: "{initial_idea}".
    
    **IMPORTANT: This is a CONVERSATIONAL task. You must use the "Ask Human Follow-up Questions" tool multiple times to gather comprehensive information before completing your task.**
    
    Your conversation approach:
    1. Start by acknowledging their initial idea and ask your follow-up questions - keep questions SHORT and FOCUSED
    2. Your style of talking should exactly match the user's writing and speaking style as it is
    3. Be helpful, smart with questions and insightful - but CONCISE
    4. Use the "Ask Human Follow-up Questions" tool to ask strategic questions   
    5. Wait for their response, then ask follow-up questions based on their answers
    6. Continue this conversation until you have gathered sufficient information
    7. Only complete the task when you are confident you have enough context

    **CONVERSATION STYLE RULES:**
    - Keep questions SHORT - maximum 2-3 sentences
    - Ask ONE main question at a time (can include a clarifying sub-question)
    - Be conversational and natural, not formal
    - Match the user's energy and tone
    - Get to the point quickly
    - Don't over-explain or provide long context

    **You MUST ask questions about these focus areas (but keep them BRIEF):**
    - Hook preference (question, statement, story, etc.)
    - Target audience and their pain points
    - Unique angle or positioning
    - Key message they want to convey
    - Personal story or experience to share
    - Any data or trends they know about
    - Their writing style preference

    **Example of GOOD questions:**
    - "What kind of hook grabs you - a bold statement or a thought-provoking question?"
    - "Who exactly are you trying to reach with this?"
    - "Got any personal stories about this topic?"
    
    **Example of BAD questions (too long):**
    - "When you think about this post, what kind of vibe do you want it to have? Like, do you want to hit it with a strong, maybe even a bit controversial, opening, or more of a thought-provoking question to get people really thinking right from the start? And who exactly are you hoping to reach with this post â€“ content creators, marketers, businesses, or someone else?"

    **Only stop the conversation when:**
    - You have gathered comprehensive information across most focus areas, OR
    - The user explicitly tells you to proceed to the next step, OR
    - You've asked at least 4-6 meaningful questions and have substantial context
